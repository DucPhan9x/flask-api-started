## Dependencies

You will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and check that it works

```bash
$ make server.install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make server.start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```

## Commands

You can display availables make commands using `make`.

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `make server.start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `make <script>`      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `help`               | Display availables make commands                                             |
| `server.install`     | Install the pip dependencies on the server's container.                      |
| `server.start`       | Run your local server in its own docker container.                           |
| `server.daemon`      | Run your local server in its own docker container as a daemon.               |
| `server.upgrade`     | Upgrade pip packages interactively.                                          |
| `database.connect`   | Connect to your docker database.                                             |
| `database.migrate`   | Generate a database migration file using alembic, based on your model files. |
| `database.upgrade`   | Run the migrations until your database is up to date.                        |
| `database.downgrade` | Downgrade your database by one migration.                                    |
| `format.black`       | Format python files using Black.                                             |
| `format.isort`       | Order python imports using isort.                                            |

## Database

The database is in [PostgreSql](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Locally, you can connect to your database using :

```bash
$ make database.connect
$ make database.upgrade
$ make database.migrate
$ make database.upgrade


```

## Development

To develop locally, here are your two options:

```bash
$ make server.start           # Create the containers containing your python server in your terminal
$ make server.daemon          # Create the containers containing your python server as a daemon
```

## Format

The code is formatted using [Black](https://github.com/python/black) and [Isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/). You have the following commands to your disposal:

```bash
$ make format.black # Apply Black on every file
$ make format.isort # Apply Isort on every file
```
